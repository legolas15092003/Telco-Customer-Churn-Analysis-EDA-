# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis-EDA- 

📊 Customer Churn Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom business using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques. The goal is to identify key factors that influence why customers leave the company and to provide data-driven insights that can help improve customer retention and profitability.

The analysis covers important customer attributes such as contract type, tenure, internet service, and value-added services including Online Security, Tech Support, Device Protection, and Streaming services. Multiple visualizations such as count plots, stacked bar charts, and distribution plots are used to compare churn behavior across different customer segments.

Key findings show that customers on month-to-month contracts and those with low tenure have the highest churn risk, while customers on long-term contracts and those using bundled services are significantly more loyal. The project also highlights that fiber-optic internet users churn more frequently than DSL users, indicating potential pricing or service quality issues in the premium segment.

Based on these insights, the project provides business recommendations such as promoting long-term contracts, bundling value-added services, improving early-customer experience, and targeting high-risk customers with retention offers. These strategies can help reduce churn, increase customer lifetime value, and improve overall business performance.

This project is designed to demonstrate real-world data analyst skills, including data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and business insight generation, making it suitable for portfolios, interviews, and practical analytics applications.
